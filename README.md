# Genomic-signatures-of-mal-adaptation-to-climate-in-English-Yew
English yew is a long-lived tree widely distributed in Europe from sea level up to 2200m, often forming small stands and/or isolated populations. Several studies have shown phenotypic differences among populations of English yew across climatic gradients, while others have found signatures of ongoing selection and identified climate-related genes. These evidences suggest that local adaptation to climate may occur across the distribution range of the English yew. Moreover, recent declines and local extinctions of this species in many parts of Europe could exacerbate the effects of climate change, particularly for mountain populations where environmental disturbances are expected to be more severe. As a result, maladaptation - when fitness of individuals deviates from the optimal fitness in a given environment - could be of particular concern across the distribution range of the English yew.  This study aims to investigate the presence of local adaptation to climate across the speciesâ€™ range and to forecast the potential maladaptation of the English yew to future climatic conditions.
